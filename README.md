# ASSEMBLY-x86-ACTIVITIES
Welcome to my Microprocessors Class Activities Compilation repository! Here, you'll find a collection of laboratory activities and assignments completed during my course, focusing on programming in x86 Assembly Language. Throughout the semester, I explored microprocessor architecture fundamentals, honed my skills in ASM programming, and applied my knowledge to various real-world scenarios. The repository is structured into directories for Laboratory Activities and Assignments, each containing relevant code and documentation. Supplementary resources are also available in the Resources section. Feel free to explore the codebase and leverage the materials for your learning needs. I greatly appreciate your feedback and contributions as I continue my journey in mastering microprocessors!
